# Merkle experimentation for airdrop

## Introduction

This repository is an experimentation that shows how Merkle Trees work, and how they can be used for pre-sale mint and airdrop process'. The code in this repository is not production-ready. Please, take into consideration concerns and comments in the [note](#notes) section before using it in production.

## Installation

All you need to do is install the dependencies needed

```shell
npm i
```

## Test

You can run the tests by running this command

```shell
npm run test
```

You can generate a gas report by running this dedicated command

```shell
npm run test:gas
```

If you want, you can customize how many addresses would be in the whitelist generated for each test by updating the environment variable called `NUMBER_OF_ADRESSES_TO_GENERATE`. 

**Note**: The tests will ensure the value passed will generate a balanced Merkle tree. If it's not the case, the default value (32) would be used.

## Utils

You can generate a random Merkle tree by running this command. 

```shell
npm run merkle
```

Want to print the Merkle created by the command above? You can use this command

```shell
npm run merkle:print
```

**Note**: The environment variable `NUMBER_OF_ADRESSES_TO_GENERATE` works for the command listed above.

## Gas snapshots

Below, are snapshots taken during a gas consumption benchmark. Keep in mind the gas cost snapshotted includes the cost of triggering an event (375 gas in that case), and the base cost (21,000 of gas). If you want to exactly know how the Merkle process cost, you have to subtract these costs.  More info [here](https://github.com/wolflo/evm-opcodes/blob/main/gas.md)

**This benchmark was made with a Merkle tree that contains 10 addresses**

**This benchmark was made with a Merkle tree that contains 200 addresses**

**This benchmark was made with a Merkle tree that contains 2,046 addresses**

**This benchmark was made with a Merkle tree that contains 10,000 addresses**

## Notes

A Merkle Tree with n leaves has O(log2 n) sized proofs. That explains the result of the benchmarks above.

This implementation checks three depths, meaning that an attacker canâ€™t just supply intermediate values directly. That means this implementation is protected against the [second pre-image attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree#Second_preimage_attack) attack. If you want to protect against this attack without checking the three depths, one of the solutions is to differentiate between leaf nodes and intermediate nodes in the tree by prepending a different byte value for leaf and intermediate nodes (such as 0x00 and 0x01 as in the certificate transparency implementation).  More info about the attack [here](https://flawed.net.nz/2018/02/21/attacking-merkle-trees-with-a-second-preimage-attack/)


Also, as is, this implementation is vulnerable to a forgery attack for an unbalanced tree, where the last leaf node can be duplicated to create an artificial balanced tree, resulting in the same Merkle root hash. Do not accept unbalanced trees to prevent this. One solution would be to populate the tree until it is balanced by using the hash of the address(0) or any dumb data that can't be provided (if you hash `msg.sender` value in your Solidity function, address(0) sounds a great contender as no one can control the private key of this address). One example of this attack [here](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=102395).
