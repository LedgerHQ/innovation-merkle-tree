# Merkle experimentation for airdrop

## Introduction

This repository is an experimentation that shows how Merkle Trees work, and how they can be used for pre-sale mint and airdrop process'. The code in this repository is not production-ready. Please, take into consideration concerns and comments in the [note](#notes) section before using it in production.

## Installation

First, install all the dependencies needed

```shell
npm i
```

Then, generate a fake whitelist by running this command

```shell
npm run whitelist:generate
```

By default, the whitelist will contain 2046 addresses. If you want to customize the number of addresses that should be generated, create a `.env` file at the root of the project and set the desired value to the variable called `NUMBER_OF_ADRESSES_TO_GENERATE`

## Test

You can run the tests by running this command

```shell
npm run test
```

You can generate a gas report by running this dedicated command

```shell
npm run test:gas
```

## Gas snapshots

Below, are snapshots taken during a gas consumption benchmark. Keep in mind the gas cost snapshotted includes the cost of triggering an event, if you want to exactly know how the Merkle process cost, you have to subtract the cost of triggering the event.

**This benchmark was made with a Merkle tree that contains 10 addresses**

**This benchmark was made with a Merkle tree that contains 200 addresses**

**This benchmark was made with a Merkle tree that contains 2,046 addresses**

**This benchmark was made with a Merkle tree that contains 10,000 addresses**

## Notes

A Merkle Tree with n leaves has O(log2 n) sized proofs. That explains the result of the benchmarks above.

As is, this implementation is vulnerable to a [second pre-image attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree#Second_preimage_attack). To protect against this, the solution is fairly simple. The idea is to differentiate between leaf nodes and intermediate nodes in the tree by prepending a different byte value for leaf and intermediate nodes (such as 0x00 and 0x01 as in the certificate transparency implementation). Alternatively, tree depth or node depth can be recorded as part of the data structure, meaning that an attacker canâ€™t just supply intermediate values directly. More info [here](https://flawed.net.nz/2018/02/21/attacking-merkle-trees-with-a-second-preimage-attack/).

Also, as is, this implementation is vulnerable to a forgery attack for an unbalanced tree, where the last leaf node can be duplicated to create an artificial balanced tree, resulting in the same Merkle root hash. Do not accept unbalanced trees to prevent this. More info [here](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=102395).
